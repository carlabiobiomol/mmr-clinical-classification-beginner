# Clinical Interpretation of MMR Variants

## Overview
This document presents a simplified clinical interpretation of simulated germline variants
in MMR genes associated with Lynch syndrome.

## Key Considerations
- Population frequency is critical to exclude benign variants.
- ClinVar classification provides supportive but not definitive evidence.
- Some variants remain VUS due to insufficient functional or segregation data.

## Clinical Perspective
Variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic may support a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome
when correlated with clinical criteria and family history.

VUS should not be used for clinical decision-making without further evidence.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a beginner-level approach to clinical variant classification,
highlighting the importance of cautious interpretation in hereditary cancer syndromes.
